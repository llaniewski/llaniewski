I'm a researcher and a programmer in the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). My main intrest include CFD Optimization, High Performance Computing and Lattice Boltzmann Method.

See my main project: [TCLB](https://github.com/CFD-GO/TCLB) - Lattice Boltzmann Method solver for multi-GPU architectures.
